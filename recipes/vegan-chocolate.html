<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A smooth and rich dark chocolate made of pure cacao ingredients</p>
<p>PREP TIME: ~ 10 mins (+ a few hours of chilling time)</p>
<p>
    SERVING: Makes 2 traditional chocolate bars and 30 individual chocolates (or
    similar amount depending on the type of molds you have)
</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>240 grams / 8.5oz Organic Cacao Butter (roughly 1 cup melted)</li>
    <li>2/3 - 3/4 cup Organic Cacao Powder</li>
    <li>4 TBS Organic Maple Syrup</li>
    <li>1 tsp Organic Pure Vanilla Extract â€” Optional</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Weigh out your cacao butter, making it roughly 240g or 8.5oz, and transfer
        to your sauce pan. Begin to heat on lowest setting to melt the cacao butter
        fully. Stir frequently for faster melting and to prevent over-heating or
        burning.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once your cacao butter is fully melted, turn off the heat. (Remove the pan
        from hot surface if applicable.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Add in the cacao powder, and stir thoroughly until it is fully mixed with
        the cacao butter, making a smooth uniform chocolate sauce.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add in the maple syrup and vanilla extract, and stir until evenly combined.
        Taste a small amount to make sure the chocolate flavor and sweetness level
        is to your liking.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place your silicone molds onto a large cookie sheet. (This helps to prevent
        spilling or uneven setting of the liquified chocolate.)
    </li>
    <li>Transfer the mixture using a tablespoon into your silicone molds.</li>
    <li>
        Place the cookie sheet(s) into the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before
        removing the chocolates from the molds.
    </li>
    <li>Store chocolates in a sealed container, in the refrigerator.</li>
</ol>
