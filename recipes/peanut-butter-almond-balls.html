<h3>Description</h3>

    Simplicity and deliciousness at its finest in these sweet and chewy treats
</p>
<p>PREP TIME: &lt; 15 mins (+ pre-soaking and chilling)</p>
<p>SERVINGS: Makes 24 to 36 balls</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup Organic Raw Almonds</li>
    <li>1 cup Organic Medjool Dates</li>
    <li>2 heaping TBSP Organic Peanut Butter</li>
    <li>1 - 2 tsp Organic Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
    <li>1 tsp Organic Cinnamon Powder</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Soak the 1 cup of dry almonds in a bowl of water for 8 to 12 hours, or
        overnight. When you are ready to work with the almonds, drain the water,
        rinse them well several times, and place them into your food processor.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove pits from the dates and place the dates into the food processor.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add all of the remaining ingredients into the food processor, and process
        until a uniform, crumbly, and sticky mixture results.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the blade from the food processor so that you can safely reach your
        hands inside or transfer the mixture into a wide dish.
    </li>
    <li>
        Take a small amount of the mixture, about 1 tablespoon, into your hand.
        Press the mixture with your fingers and roll around between your hands to
        form a ball. Repeat this process until you have used up all of the mixture.
        The balls should be about the size of a truffle or slightly bigger.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place the formed balls into a glass container that can be sealed tight with
        a lid, and place the dish into the refrigerator to set and chill for a few
        hours. You can place the balls in the freezer for about 2 hours to set
        faster or for about 4 hours into the fridge. The balls can also be eaten
        immediately in their soft state.
    </li>
    <li>
        Store the balls in the fridge and aim to consume within 1 to 2 weeks, or
        freeze for long-term storage.
    </li>
</ol>
