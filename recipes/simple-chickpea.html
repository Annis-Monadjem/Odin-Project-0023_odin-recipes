<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    This is a delicious, quick, easy version of the famous Indian dish “Chana
    Masala.”
</p>
<p>PREP TIME: &gt;60 mins or &lt;15 mins with pre-cooked beans</p>
<p>SERVINGS: makes about 4 servings</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups Organic Dry Chickpeas / Garbanzo Beans - soaked and cooked</li>
    <li>2 cups Organic Strained Tomatoes, Tomato Purée, or Tomato Paste</li>
    <li>1 Organic Onion (type and size of your choice)</li>
    <li>1 - 3 TBSP Organic Garam Masala Spice Mix Powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp Organic Garlic Powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp Organic Ginger Root Powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp Unrefined Sea Salt</li>
    <li>OPTIONAL: ¼ - ½ tsp Organic Cayenne Pepper Powder</li>
    <li>OPTIONAL: some fresh Organic Cilantro leaves for garnish</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Prepare your chickpeas by soaking them overnight and cooking in plenty of
        fresh water in your large pot for about 45 to 60 minutes or until desired
        softness is reached.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once you have cooked chickpeas, place a thin layer of water in the large
        stainless steel pan and begin to heat it on medium.
    </li>
    <li>
        Peel the outer layers of your onion and chop or dice finely. Add the onion
        to your pan, cover with a lid, and cook for about 5 minutes to soften.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the tomato purée/paste to the cooked chickpeas, along with the softened
        onion and all of your spices. Start with a lower amount of the garam masala
        and add more later if needed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Begin to heat all this on high, and then lower the temperature to low to
        heat everything thoroughly for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    </li>
    <li>
        Taste the mixture, and add more of your spices as may be desired. NOTE: Some
        garam masala spice mix is already very spicy and some are very mild, in
        which case you can add some cayenne pepper powder to boost the spiciness
        levels.
    </li>
    <li>Serve warm alongside cooked brown rice or another grain, as desired.</li>
</ol>
